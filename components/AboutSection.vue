      <h1>about me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a web developer based in Hungary. I've been programming and creating
        websites on and off since I was 12 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been fond of computers ever since my childhood. I got interested in
        programming through the games I've played back then, like MTA:SA and
        Minecraft. These games helped me learn about configuring, scripting and
        hosting them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've quit high school in 2016, because I've found that it was
        inefficient at teaching me about topics that actually interest me. Since
        then, I've been seriously learning about programming and related fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, I've finally got a job at a company called WebOrigo. I've
        worked (and still do) on multiple projects there, most of the time solo,
        but I've acquired experience working with other people too.
