      <h1>about me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a web developer based in Hungary. I've been programming and creating
        websites on and off since I was 12 years old.

        I quit high school in 2016, because I wanted to spend my time learning
        about topics that interest me, like programming. Sadly, once my initial
        burst of motivation ran out, more and more of my time was spent on
        playing video games and other not so useful activities. I've still
        learnt a lot in this period of my life, but it could've gone a lot
        better.

        In 2019, I've finally finished high school at an evening school. Since
        then, I've decided that I want to do web development for a living, and
        to achieve that, I've spent most of my time developing hobby projects,
        some of which are displayed below.
